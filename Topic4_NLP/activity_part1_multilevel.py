AIT-204 Deep Learning | Topic 4 Extended: Advanced NLP
ACTIVITY — PART 1: Multi-Level Sentiment Analysis
============================================================================

PURPOSE:
    Extend the binary sentiment classifier from Topic 4 into a fine-grained,
    multi-class model that distinguishes 7 levels of sentiment:
        0 = Extremely Negative   3 = Neutral   6 = Extremely Positive
    You will modify the model output layer, switch to CrossEntropyLoss,
    and evaluate with a confusion matrix.

DURATION: ~75 minutes  (see time targets per section below)

PREREQUISITES:
    Complete Topic 4 (Activities 1-3) first. This activity imports your
    preprocessing module from Topic 4 and builds on its architecture.

BRIDGING THE GAP (Concept -> Algorithm -> Code):
    ---------------------------------------------------------------
    PROBLEM: Binary sentiment misses nuance.
        "I liked it a little"  -> POSITIVE (same as "masterpiece!")
        "It was okay"          -> NEGATIVE (same as "absolute disaster!")

    SOLUTION — ORDINAL MULTI-CLASS CLASSIFICATION:
        Instead of outputting 1 probability, output a vector of K scores.
        The highest score determines the predicted class.

        Binary (Topic 4):          Multi-Class (Topic 5):
        -----------------          ----------------------
        Input -> ... -> FC(hid,1)  Input -> ... -> FC(hid,7)
                     -> Sigmoid()               -> (argmax at inference)
        Output: 1 number (0–1)     Output: 7 numbers (logits)
        Loss: BCELoss              Loss: CrossEntropyLoss

    KEY DIFFERENCE — LOSS FUNCTION:
        BCELoss:          compares ONE probability to ONE binary label
        CrossEntropyLoss: compares K logits to ONE integer class index
            - Applies softmax internally
            - Expects labels as torch.long (integers 0 to K-1)

    KEY DIFFERENCE — ACCURACY CALCULATION:
        Binary:     (output > 0.5).float()   <- threshold
        Multi-class: output.argmax(dim=1)    <- pick highest logit

WHAT YOU'LL IMPLEMENT:  (7 TODOs, ~10 min each)
    TODO 1: Explore dataset — label distribution & class balance (10 min)
    TODO 2: Modify model — change output from 1 neuron to num_classes (10 min)
    TODO 3: Update forward() — remove sigmoid, return raw logits (5 min)
    TODO 4: Set up loss — CrossEntropyLoss + class weights (10 min)
    TODO 5: Fix training loop — argmax accuracy, label dtype (15 min)
    TODO 6: Evaluate — confusion matrix + per-class F1 (15 min)
    TODO 7: Inference — return class name + full confidence distribution (10 min)

# =========================================================================
# The training loop structure is IDENTICAL to Topic 4.
# Only three things change — everything else (optimizer, forward pass,
# backward pass, scheduler) stays exactly the same.
#
# ── CHANGE 1: Loss function ───────────────────────────────────────────────
#
#   Topic 4:   criterion = nn.BCELoss()
#              loss = criterion(sigmoid_output, float_label)
#              · sigmoid_output shape: (batch, 1)  — one probability per example
#              · float_label    dtype: torch.float — values 0.0 or 1.0
#
#   Here:      criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
#              loss = criterion(logits, int_label)
#              · logits    shape: (batch, num_classes) — one raw score per class
#              · int_label dtype: torch.long           — values 0, 1, … K-1
#
#   WHY CrossEntropyLoss?
#   It packages three operations into one numerically stable call:
#     a) Softmax  — converts K raw scores into a probability distribution
#                   so all values are in (0,1) and sum to 1.0
#     b) Log      — takes the natural log of each probability.
#                   log(p near 1) ≈ 0  (small penalty for confident+correct)
#                   log(p near 0) → -∞ (large penalty for confident+wrong)
#     c) NLL      — picks only the log-probability of the TRUE class,
#                   negates it:  loss = -log(prob_true_class)
#
#   In one formula:
#     loss_i = -log( exp(logit_true) / Σ_j exp(logit_j) )
#
#   Intuition: the loss asks "how surprised was the model by the correct
#   answer?" Perfect confidence → loss ≈ 0. Total ignorance → loss is large.
#   Training minimises this surprise across the whole dataset.
#
#   CRITICAL: Do NOT apply sigmoid or softmax inside the model before
#   passing to CrossEntropyLoss. It expects RAW logits. Passing
#   probabilities produces incorrect (compressed) gradients and the
#   model will appear to train but will learn poorly.
#
# ── CHANGE 2: Accuracy calculation ───────────────────────────────────────
#
#   Topic 4:   preds = (output > 0.5).float()
#              · Thresholds a single probability at 0.5.
#              · Only works for exactly two classes.
#
#   Here:      preds = logits.argmax(dim=1)
#              · Scans ALL K logits for each example and returns the INDEX
#                of the highest value.
#              · Example: logits = [-1.2,  0.3,  2.1, -0.5, 0.8, -0.2, 1.4]
#                         argmax → 2   (class "Negative" has the highest score)
#              · dim=1 means "scan across classes", not across the batch.
#              · Works for any K ≥ 2 with no threshold to tune.
#
# ── CHANGE 3: Label dtype ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
#   Topic 4:   labels → torch.float  (BCELoss compares to 0.0 / 1.0)
#
#   Here:      labels → torch.long   (CrossEntropyLoss uses them as integer
#                                     indices to index into the logit vector)
#
#   If you accidentally pass float labels you will see this error:
#     "RuntimeError: expected scalar type Long but found Float"
#   Fix: preprocess_dataset() already returns torch.long by default —
#   just make sure you never cast labels with .float() before the loss.

# ── REFLECTION QUESTIONS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# 1. LOSS FUNCTION: Why does CrossEntropyLoss not require a sigmoid
#    at the end of the model, while BCELoss does require it?
#    (Hint: Look up what CrossEntropyLoss computes internally)
#
# 2. CLASS IMBALANCE: If your training data has 100 "Neutral" examples
#    but only 10 "Extremely Negative" examples, what happens to the model?
#    How do class weights in CrossEntropyLoss address this?
#
# 3. ORDINAL LABELS: Sentiment classes have a natural order:
#    Extremely Negative < Very Negative < ... < Extremely Positive
#    But CrossEntropyLoss treats all misclassifications equally —
#    predicting class 0 when the true class is 1 is penalized the same
#    as predicting class 6. Is this a problem? What loss function would
#    respect the ordinal structure? (Hint: look up "ordinal regression")
#
# 4. CONFUSION MATRIX: After training, which adjacent classes does your
#    model most often confuse (e.g., Negative vs. Slightly Negative)?
#    Why might adjacent classes be harder to distinguish?
#
