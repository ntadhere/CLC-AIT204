# Linear Regression and Differentiation Essentials

## Part 1
### 1. Interpret $\frac{dy}{dx}$ geometrically
- This is the slope of the tangent line to the curve $y=f(x)$ at a point $x=a$ 
- It represents the instantaneous rate of change of $y$ with respect to $x$
- Positive slope: curve increasing
- Negative slope: curve decresing
- Shope 0: horizontal tangent (often local max/min)
- Formally, it is the limit of secant slopes:
$$
\left.\frac{dy}{dx}\right|_{x=a}
=
\lim_{h \to 0}
\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h}
$$
